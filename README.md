Beam Stabilization

Application developed to stabilize the path of a laser beam on an optical table. Two motorized mirrors correct the reference positions of the laser beam on two CCD cameras. This ensures that the beam path does not change over time and can be readjusted quickly and automised if the laser moved during shut down. Laser drifts in a running measurement can be caused by thermal fluctuations, mechanical vibrations or other sources changing optical elements. The automatic beam stabilization ensures stability of experimental conditions also for long term measurements.
